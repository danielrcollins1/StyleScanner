# StyleScanner

This program scans starting student C++ code files for basic styling errors.

Expected format broadly aligns with the style seen in Gaddis C++ textbooks.
Header comments are assumed to be as per the Dev-C++ comment header default snippet.
Output is categorized & summarized for brevity.

Compile StyleScanner and (most simply) move the program to scan into the same directory.
Then run StyleScanner on the command-line, giving the program to scan as the one argument.

Example invocation: **.\StyleScanner MyProgram.cpp**
